# Gym-Management-System-
*work in progress*

This project was created using vs code, and xampp and was run on Google Chrome

to run project, first follow the step in Queries.txt

next, copy files in project and paste it in the htdocs folder located in the xampp folder
or C:\xampp\htdocs

next, start your apache and mysql server using xampp control panel and on your browser, search localhost/project/

run gymlogin.html

username and password is hardcoded for now
user: System
pass: admin

from here, you can select to edit member or trainer forms, or view equipments in the gym and the maintenance date

Issues with equipment, 
machines info hardcoded and cant be updated
updating maintenance date does nothing for now (still developing)

possible issues with member/trainer sections:-
deformed interface due to incompatible browsers,
rare occasion of update table not working (works about 80% of the time),
random images given weird names for entertainment purposes.

*currently working on fixing current issues*
